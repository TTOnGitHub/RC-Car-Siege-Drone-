# RC Car Project

This is a project to build a remote-controlled car based on a **Rainbow Six Siege drone**, with open-source code for controlling it.

## 3D Print Files

The 3D print files for the RC car can be downloaded from [Cults3D - Functional RC Car Siege Drone](https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/game/functional-rc-car-siege-drone). Simply follow the link to **purchase** and download the necessary parts for 3D printing.

## Code

The code for controlling the RC car is written in **Arduino IDE** and can be found in the `SRC/esp_code.cpp` file of the repository. Instructions for uploading and using the code are included in the [Docs/Instructions.md](./Docs/instructions.md) folder.

## Instructions

Detailed instructions for building the RC car, including assembly, wiring, and uploading the code, can be found in the [Docs/Instructions.md](./Docs/instructions.md).
